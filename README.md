## Directory introduction

### ReadQC
Raw sequencing data (Read) quality control, including long reads (Whole genome sequencing, WGS)/ short reads (WGS, RNA-seq).

### SNPIndelDetection (Preparing)
SNP and Indel calling and filtering using short reads based on the reference genome

### PopulationGeneticAnalysis (Preparing)
Population genetic analysis based on filtered SNPs such as phylogenetic tree, PCA, PI, Fst, XP-CLR and Population structure inferring

### GenomeAssembly (Preparing)
High-quality genome assembly using long reads, short reads and Hi-C

### AssemblyBenchmark
BUSCO, QUAST, LAI benchmark of genome assembly

### RepeatAnnotation (Preparing)
Repeat element annotation with genome

### GeneAnnotation (Preparing)
Gene annotation with genome
